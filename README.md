# Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversarial-Network-Data-Augmentation-
We are detecting yellow rust disease in wheat using real-time artificial intelligence (U-Net) technology from satellite images.In this project, we trained a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate artificial wheat field image after showing it pictures of many real wheat field.
